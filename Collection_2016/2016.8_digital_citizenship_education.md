1. I will get to know the services and Web sites my child uses. If  I don’t know how to use them, I will take the time to learn how.
2. I will teach my children to understand that other people do not have the same access to technology. I will demonstrate to my child that all technology users should be treated the same.
3. I will work with my child to understand the issues around online purchases. I will show my child which sites are safe and secure for 
buying goods online. I will also help to explain how to search and find the best deals online.  
4. I promise to teach my child when and how to use digital communication methods. I understand that technology may not always be the best way to interact with others.
5. I will help everyone in our family to understand that our technology usage affects others. I will help my child to understand they need to act the way they want to be treated.
6. I will try to get to know my child’s “online friends” just as I try get to know his or her other friends. I will explain that to have rights online there are certain responsibilities as well.
7. I will teach my children that there are some material that is available online that is protected and cannot be taken without permission. Children need to understand that this material is owned by others and they have rights to be protected.
8. I will explain to my children when using technology they need to be at proper heights for their size to keep from causing physical harm. I will also make sure that my children have limits on the time they can use technology as not to become addicted to the technology.
9. I will spend time to teach my child to protect their technology and data by having adequate virus, spyware and adware software. I will also show that that having protection is important for all technology.
